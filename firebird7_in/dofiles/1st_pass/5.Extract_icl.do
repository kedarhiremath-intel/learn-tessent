// This script is a basic demonstration of how to extract the ICL.
// After we added new DFT instruments to the design with the Tessent DFT specification, we must incorporate the ICL descriptions of the new Tessent DFT instruments into the block ICL.

// Step 1. Extract the ICL

extract_icl

// If we encounter a DRC error on a more complex block, we can influence the process of ICL extraction. We will learn that in a later session.
