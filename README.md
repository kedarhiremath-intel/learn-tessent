# learn-tessent
This repository is a portable sandbox environment for learning the DFT insertion flow using vanilla Tessent shell commands and the workflow recommended by Siemens EDA. I will develop a variety of use cases with a special emphasis on the Iron Wood and Powder Mill projects.

This project is strictly for reference and education. You cannot use the learn-tessent flow scripts for execution, as they are not (nor are they intended to be) production-ready.

The intent is to show you what Intel frameworks like TEAMaker and MINT are actually doing "behind the scenes", so you will be very well-prepared to use these or other Tessent-based tools, flows and methodologies.

This is an entirely self-contained repository, meaning that there is no external dependency, with the exception of the CAD tools which should already be present on your system.
