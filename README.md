# learn-tessent
This repository is a sandbox environment for running the DFT insertion flow using plain vanilla Tessent commands, with a special emphasis on the Iron Wood and Powder Mill projects.
The intent is to show you what frameworks like TEAMaker and MINT are actually doing "behind the scenes", so you will be well-prepared to use these or other Tessent-based tools, flows and methodologies.

There is no dependency on any group or repository. All the required files are contained within this repository, with the exception of the CAD tools which should already be present on your system.

Here is the high-level Tessent insertion flow:

Okay? Now let's zoom in on each box.
